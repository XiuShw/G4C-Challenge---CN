    - "y:Today I took a look at the food pantry and discovered that there\u2019s
      a heavy imbalance of nutrition-0110l"
    - "p:People don\u2019t care about fancy meals. They need calories to survive,
      that\u2019s it. We provide what we can.0310r"
    - y:But malnutrition is making them sicker. They need more than just empty calories.
      Their children are stunted, people are getting weaker-0310l
    - "p:Oh, come on. We\u2019re giving them free food. They should be grateful.
      It\u2019s not a gourmet restaurant.0312r"
    - "p:Besides, did you not notice their ungrateful behavior? Work productivity
      in the factories have been seriously declining. It\u2019s a shame, I was earning
      so much from them.0312r"
    - "y:The productivity problems are a product of malnourishment. Having food isn\u2019t
      enough, there needs to be a balance of nutrition. And I\u2019m not talking
      about luxury here. It\u2019s a basic human need. Processed food is keeping
      them hungry, making them dependent.0312l"
    - p:Hah, you should know. Keep them dependent, they stay in line. If they get
      too strong, they start asking for more.0311r
    - "y:\u20260311l"
    - You realize the depth of corruption is way deeper than you initially thought.
      The system isn't failing by accident. It's designed to keep the poor weak and
      controlled.0311l
