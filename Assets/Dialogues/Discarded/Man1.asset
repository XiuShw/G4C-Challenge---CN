    - You spot a man who is working on the factory line. You are surprised that the
      factory is operating at this hour.
    - y:Excuse me, sir. This may be quite sudden, but here is some food. I noticed
      that the food was not being properly distributed here.
    - "Middle-aged man:\u2026I\u2019m doing my job right now."
    - "y:Yes. I will just leave the food here. If you\u2026ever take a break, be
      sure to eat. It\u2019s-"
    - "Middle-aged man:I don\u2019t want it. Who knows what kind of hidden agenda
      you have?"
    - "The man angrily turns back to work. You can sense that he doesn\u2019t want
      to engage in conversation anymore. You decide to leave the food beside him."
