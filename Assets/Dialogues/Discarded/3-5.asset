    - Hunger is a severe issue that our world faces.0000l
    - "However, it\u2019s not because we don\u2019t have enough food. Rather, it\u2019s
      because so much of the food goes to waste. In fact, 20% of food produced for
      human consumption is lost or wasted globally.0000l"
    - "To truly visualize this, the food we waste and lose every year requires nearly
      30% of the world\u2019s agricultural land. This is {LARGER} than the surface
      area of China and India.0000l"
    - "Food waste can happen for a variety of reasons. \u201CUgly\u201D food is often
      thrown away for no good reason, sometimes farmers simply don\u2019t have the
      storage space for that much food, or when edible or surplus food is thrown
      away by retailers or consumers.0000l"
    - "If we stopped wasting all that food, we\u2019d save enough to feed {2 billion}
      people.0000l"
    - There are ways to reduce food waste, though it is difficult. For example, helping
      farmers by giving them better technology and resources to store and transport
      their food, implementing policies that require retailers to manage their food
      more wisely...0000l
    - Even you could help make a difference by avoiding buying unnecessary food and
      asking to buy ugly foods in stores.0000l
